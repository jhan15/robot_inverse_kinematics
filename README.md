## Description

In this project, we program the inverse kinematic algorithm for a robot, which will move its joints so that it follows a desired path with the end-effector.

It is composed of two parts:

* A 3 DOF scara robot, with an inverse kinematic solution that is possible in analytic form.
* A 7 DOF kuka robot, with the inverse kinematic solution to be implemented with iterative algorithms.

### Scara robot

The following image shows the distances between the joints and the end-effector frame, in the robot's zero configuration. Two joints (q1 and q2) are revolute, and one (q3) is prismatic. Notice that the end-effector frame and the base frame are at the same height, which means that the end-effector z coordinate coincides with the value of the last prismatic joint (q3).

### Kuka robot

This robot has a kinematics structure much more complex than the scara, therefore it is not feasible to obtain an analytic solution for the inverse kinematics problem. The inputs to this function are: 

* point = (x, y, z), the desired position of the end-effector.
* R = 3x3 rotation matrix, the desired orientation of the end-effector.
* joint_positions = (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q5, q7) the current joint positions.

The output of this function is a vector q containing the 7 joint values that give the desired pose of the end-effector.

This is the DH table of the kuka robot, with the depicted frames:

</p>

The DH table follows this convention:

* `a_i` distance between `z_i-1` and `z_i` along the axis `x_i`
* `alpha_i` angle between `z_i-1` and `z_i` about the axis `x_i`
* `d_i` distance between `x_i-1` and `x_i` along the axis `z_i-1`
* `theta_i` angle between `x_i-1` and `x_i` about the axis `z_i-1`

The frame transformation can be found as:
